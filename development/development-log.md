## Status Update 1:

 Currently I have completed the statement of purpose and the scope of the application, I have listed 4 features so far, this includes the menu/difficulty selection, WPM system, Accuracy system, and leader board feature (the leader board is tentative). I also outlined the intended user experience and interaction regarding the features of the app. I implemented a flowchart diagram that displays the flow of the program and will be altered if needed, as with the documentation.

The implmentation plan was completed earlier this morning, this was due yesterday but due to circumstances in IRL, I was unable to (fell sick... but I should be okay at this point). I am utilizing Trello and a workflow table to keep track of tasks, applying deadlines to each, and prioritising the integral features first. I also included a checklist for each feature/task which is also prioritised.

What I found so far is that prevalent modules exist already to keep track of WPM (wpm 1.51.5) and that is somewhat discouraging but I will attempt to create my own. At this point I feel I will have the most trouble integrating/creating my WPM system, and the leader board feature as well. But I will delve deeper into both subjects to accomplish these tasks.
